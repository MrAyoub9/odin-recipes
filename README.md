# odin-recipes

This was my first project within the Odin Project course.
In this project Called Odin-recipes, four html pages has been created.
index.html was created in the main folder and it includes a title, an image and a list of links.
macaron/lace-cookies/oatmeal-bars.html were created inside a folder called recipes. Each page included a title of the recipe, an image, a description, and the instructions.
All the pages were made using:
 h1 tag, img tag, ul and li tags, a tag, and fieldset tag.
CSS was used to improve the look of the pages including resizing and centering elements with the use of colors.
