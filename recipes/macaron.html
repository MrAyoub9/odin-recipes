            <p>
                A macaron or French macaron is a sweet meringue-based confection 
                made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, 
                and food colouring. The macaron is traditionally held to have been 
                introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici
                during the Renaissance.

            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons superfine sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons finely ground almonds</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
             </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicon mat.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, 
                    about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li> whisk the superfine sugar into the egg whites 
                    until thick, glossy, and the mixture holds stiff peaks, 5 to 8 
                    more minutes.</li>
                <li>Place a sieve over the bowl containing egg whites 
                    and sieve both amounts of almond meal and confectioners' sugar 
                    into the egg white mixture.</li>
                <li> Gently fold the almond meal and 
                    confectioners' sugar into the egg whites, retaining as much air 
                    as possible.</li>
                <li>Separate the meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, 
                    if desired.<br> Spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with 
                    a 3/8-inch tip.<br> Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared 
                    baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
                <li>Let the cookies stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes 
                    to form a thin skin.</li>
                <li> Pick up the baking sheets and let drop from 
                    several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the 
                    baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; 
                    let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the 
                    parchment paper.</li>
